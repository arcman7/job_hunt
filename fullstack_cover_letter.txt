I'm a recent grad of Dev Bootcamp with a bachelors in physics.  I have a real passion for building projects from the foundation up to the front-end UI andI really enjoy working with software frameworks that allow me to tinker wit every aspect of the codebase.  I've had some experience working on software in scientific context, and now I'd really like to start building beautiful client facing products while utilizing my analytical skills to build a really solid backend.
