I'm a recent grad of Dev Bootcamp with a bachelors in physics.  I have a real passion for building projects from the foundation up to the front-end UI andI really enjoy working with software frameworks that allow me to tinker wit every aspect of the codebase.  I've had some experience working on software in scientific context, and now I'd really like to start building beautiful client facing products while utilizing my analytical skills to build a really solid backend.


I believe that ZeroCater is the perfect place to start applying the skills that I have in a way that really aligns with my interests and passions. I really like the idea behind the service  and I'm sure I'll make a great asset to ZeroCater's team.

Cheers,
Ryan
