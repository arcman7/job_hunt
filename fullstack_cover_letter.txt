Hi, I'm a recent grad of Dev Bootcamp with a bachelors in physics. I have a real passion for building projects from the foundation up to the front-end UI and I really enjoy working with software frameworks that allow me to tinker with every aspect of the codebase.  I've had some experience working on software in scientific context, and now I'd really like to start building beautiful client facing products while utilizing my analytical skills to build a really solid backend.


My name is Andrew and I'm excited to be applying for your Full Stack Software Engineer position! I'm trying to brand myself with a company that has great team dynamics, room where I can grow with long term, and has a great work-culture / ethic. I feel like Dot & Bo is the right place. I love the vibe and learning pace Dot & Bo promotes and I'd love to be a part of it!
