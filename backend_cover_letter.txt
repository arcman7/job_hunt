Hi, I'm a recent grad of Dev Bootcamp with a bachelors in physics. I have a real passion for building projects from their foundations up with the most scalabe architecture patterns in mind. I enjoy solving complex problems and unraveling bizzare errors. I also really love optimization problems. I do my best to always design and implement fast and efficient code.

I've had some experience working on software in the scientific context, and now I'd really like to start building meaningfull client facing products while utilizing my analytical skills to build a really solid backend.
